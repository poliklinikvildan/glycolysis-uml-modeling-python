Description:
This project provides a detailed use case modeling of the glycolysis pathway using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Python. It identifies the key enzymes (actors) involved in glycolysis, their goals, and the biochemical reactions (use cases) they catalyze. The project includes Python code to generate UML diagrams that visually represent the enzymatic steps of glycolysis, facilitating a clearer understanding of this essential biochemical pathway. This integration of software engineering principles with biochemistry offers an educational tool for students and professionals in both fields.
